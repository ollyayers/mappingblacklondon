# mappingblacklondon
The Mapping Black London in World War II project began in January 2020 and was completed in March 2021 by a team of Northeastern researchers in Boston and at the New College of the Humanities in London. In that time, the team discovered evidence of a black presence in the capital across over 500 locations involving 425 named individuals from across the world. The results, in our view, provide a powerful and visually impactful tool that demonstrates the long-range presence of non-white people in London. In addition, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to explore this data opens up a range of exciting analytical possibilities for researchers to explore new lines of enquiry about the nature, scale and local dynamics of the multiracial city.

This Git includes all the data used for the project broken into a series of spreadsheets. These spreadsheets include:
	- MBL Individuals
	- MBL Master
	- MBL AfAm Individuals and Photos
